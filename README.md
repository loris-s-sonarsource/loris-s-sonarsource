👋 Hi there, I’m Loris!

I work at @SonarSource as an AppSec Researcher.

My job consists in contributing to the 🐳 Sonar AppSec team 🐳.

- We ensure Sonar's analyzers do not raise false positive and false negative issues.
- We write the text that Sonar products (such as SonarQube) raise. [_Here is an example._](https://next.sonarqube.com/sonarqube/coding_rules?q=S3649&open=javasecurity%3AS3649)
- We bring new security issues to detect into Sonar's analyzers.

You can vote on what I should work on next in [this portal](https://portal.productboard.com/sonarsource/3-sonarqube/tabs/5-under-consideration), under "**Languages and Analysis Technologies**."
I am specialized in security issues, so if you vote for a card called "_Detect Server-Side Template injection_," I am going to work on it! 🎉

Do not hesitate to reach out to my team or me by posting in our [Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). If the post is about security analysis capabilities, I might be the one to respond 😱

Cheers!
